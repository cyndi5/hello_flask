<p>My legal name is Charles D. Cavanaugh, Ph.D., and I go by Cynthia and prefer feminine pronouns. Yes, I am a proud transgender woman! 👩😊 I have a doctorate in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Arlington, studying real-time distributed computer systems. My research was part of a defense-sponsored project, and I did a summer internship at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in northern Virginia during that time. </p>
            <p>Afterward, I moved to Lafayette, LA to be a professor at UL Lafayette, specializing in distributed and embedded systems. I earned $143,000 in grant funds for equipment, summer salary and personnel during my first year. I led the development “CajunBot” which successfully qualified in the “DARPA Grand Challenge” robotic vehicle competition and attracted national news media. </p>
            <p>Following that, I moved on to become a consultant at LSU, where I worked with supercomputers across Louisiana, helping to build a customized distributed set of services and and application for scientists to apply for, use, and track expense and usage of high performance computing resources in detail. I’ve worked in various contracting and independent jobs, and in April 2016 found a new home in CGI Federal as a senior software developer. I primarily work on a cloud and container-aware project and have utilized skills ranging from Linux to Java and JavaScript and am always learning. </p>
            <p>Currently, I am self-employed and provide design and consulting support for cloud computing, robotics and embedded systems.</p>
